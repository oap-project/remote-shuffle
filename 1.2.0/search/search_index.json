This is an essential part of enabling Spark on disaggregated compute and storage architecture. There are two shuffle plugins in this project. - shuffle-hadoop, A remote shuffle plugin based Hadoop filesystem. This plugin can work with any remote filesystems compatible with Hadoop, like HDFS, AWS S3 and DAOS . - shuffle-daos Different from the above general plugin based on Hadoop Filesystem interface, this plugin bases on DAOS Object API. Thanks to DAOS Distribution Key and Attribute Key, we can improve performance by constructing shuffle output like below. Developer Guide Build and Deploy We have provided a Conda package which will automatically install dependencies needed by OAP, you can refer to OAP-Installation-Guide for more information. If you have finished OAP-Installation-Guide , you can find compiled remote shuffle jars under $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars . Then just skip this section and jump to User Guide . Build using the following command in remote-shuffle folder. This file needs to be deployed on every compute node that runs Spark. Manually place it on all nodes or let resource manager do the work. mvn -DskipTests clean package User Guide (shuffle-hadoop) Enable Remote Shuffle Add the .jar files to the classpath of Spark driver and executors: Put the following configurations in spark-defaults.conf or Spark submit command line arguments. Note: For DAOS users, DAOS Hadoop/Java API jars should also be included in the classpath as we leverage DAOS Hadoop filesystem. spark.executor.extraClassPath $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/remote-shuffle-<version>.jar spark.driver.extraClassPath $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/remote-shuffle-<version>.jar Enable the remote shuffle manager and specify the Hadoop storage system URI holding shuffle data. spark.shuffle.manager org.apache.spark.shuffle.remote.RemoteShuffleManager spark.shuffle.remote.storageMasterUri daos://default:1 # Or hdfs://namenode:port, file:///my/shuffle/dir Configurations Configurations and tuning parameters that change the behavior of remote shuffle. Most of them should work well under default values. Shuffle Root Directory This is to configure the root directory holding remote shuffle files. For each Spark application, a directory named after application ID is created under this root directory. spark.shuffle.remote.filesRootDirectory /shuffle Index Cache Size This is to configure the cache size for shuffle index files per executor. Shuffle data includes data files and index files. An index file is small but will be read many (the number of reducers) times. On a large scale, constantly reading these small index files from Hadoop Filesystem implementation(i.e. HDFS) is going to cause much overhead and latency. In addition, the shuffle files\u2019 transfer completely relies on the network between compute nodes and storage nodes. But the network inside compute nodes are not fully utilized. The index cache can eliminate the overhead of reading index files from storage cluster multiple times. By enabling index file cache, a reduce task fetches them from the remote executors who write them instead of reading from storage. If the remote executor doesn\u2019t have a desired index file in its cache, it will read the file from storage and cache it locally. The feature can also be disabled by setting the value to zero. spark.shuffle.remote.index.cache.size 30m Number of Threads Reading Data Files This is one of the parameters influencing shuffle read performance. It is to determine number of threads per executor reading shuffle data files from storage. spark.shuffle.remote.numReadThreads 5 Number of Threads Transitioning Index Files (when index cache is enabled) This is one of the parameters influencing shuffle read performance. It is to determine the number of client and server threads that transmit index information from another executor\u2019s cache. It is only valid when the index cache feature is enabled. spark.shuffle.remote.numIndexReadThreads 3 Bypass-merge-sort Threshold This threshold is used to decide using bypass-merge(hash-based) shuffle or not. By default we disable(by setting it to -1) hash-based shuffle writer in remote shuffle, because when memory is relatively sufficient, sort-based shuffle writer is often more efficient than the hash-based one. Hash-based shuffle writer entails a merging process, performing 3x I/Os than total shuffle size: 1 time for read I/Os and 2 times for write I/Os, this can be an even larger overhead under remote shuffle: the 3x shuffle size is gone through network, arriving at a remote storage system. spark.shuffle.remote.bypassMergeThreshold -1 Configurations fetching port for HDFS When the backend storage is HDFS, we contact http://$host:$port/conf to fetch configurations. They were not locally loaded because we assume absence of local storage. spark.shuffle.remote.hdfs.storageMasterUIPort 50070 Inherited Spark Shuffle Configurations These configurations are inherited from upstream Spark, they are still supported in remote shuffle.

For each Spark application, a directory named after application ID is created under this root directory. spark.shuffle.remote.filesRootDirectory /shuffle Index Cache Size This is to configure the cache size for shuffle index files per executor. Shuffle data includes data files and index files. An index file is small but will be read many (the number of reducers) times. On a large scale, constantly reading these small index files from Hadoop Filesystem implementation(i.e. HDFS) is going to cause much overhead and latency. In addition, the shuffle files\u2019 transfer completely relies on the network between compute nodes and storage nodes. But the network inside compute nodes are not fully utilized. The index cache can eliminate the overhead of reading index files from storage cluster multiple times. By enabling index file cache, a reduce task fetches them from the remote executors who write them instead of reading from storage. If the remote executor doesn\u2019t have a desired index file in its cache, it will read the file from storage and cache it locally. The feature can also be disabled by setting the value to zero. spark.shuffle.remote.index.cache.size 30m Number of Threads Reading Data Files This is one of the parameters influencing shuffle read performance. It is to determine number of threads per executor reading shuffle data files from storage. spark.shuffle.remote.numReadThreads 5 Number of Threads Transitioning Index Files (when index cache is enabled) This is one of the parameters influencing shuffle read performance. It is to determine the number of client and server threads that transmit index information from another executor\u2019s cache. It is only valid when the index cache feature is enabled. spark.shuffle.remote.numIndexReadThreads 3 Bypass-merge-sort Threshold This threshold is used to decide using bypass-merge(hash-based) shuffle or not. By default we disable(by setting it to -1) hash-based shuffle writer in remote shuffle, because when memory is relatively sufficient, sort-based shuffle writer is often more efficient than the hash-based one. Hash-based shuffle writer entails a merging process, performing 3x I/Os than total shuffle size: 1 time for read I/Os and 2 times for write I/Os, this can be an even larger overhead under remote shuffle: the 3x shuffle size is gone through network, arriving at a remote storage system. spark.shuffle.remote.bypassMergeThreshold -1 Configurations fetching port for HDFS When the backend storage is HDFS, we contact http://$host:$port/conf to fetch configurations.
